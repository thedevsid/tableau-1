import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Import the data
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Split the data into features and target
X = data["features"]
y = data["target"]

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)

# Evaluate the model
print(model.score(X, y))
linear regression model is then created and fit to the data. Finally, the model is evaluated by printing its score.

To run this code, you will need to install the numpy, pandas, and sklearn libraries. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

Once you have installed the libraries, you can run the code by saving it as a Python file and then running it from the command line.
 For example, if you save the code as  you can run it by running the following command in your terminal:

python 
This will print the score of the linear regression model, which is a measure of how well the model fits the data.
